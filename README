
No Breivik Chrome Extension
---------------------------

In Norway, the trial against the person behind the terrorist attacks in Oslo 22/07/2011 begins shortly. A lot of norwegians are tired of constantly reading about the terrorist in the news, as well as seeing pictures of him. Therefore I have created a simple Chrome extension that just replaces articles containing the "Breivik" keyword with an empty placeholder, so users tired of reading about him can choose to not see them.
